# Phase 1 Project

Hi! I'm Branton Kieti. I'm a data analyst with a background in entrepreneurship, project management, and sales.My analytical approach includes using Python and SQL for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. I specialize in identifying patterns, trends, and areas for improvement within the data.When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me spending time with my family, working out, or learning something new.Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments.

## Project Overview

For this project, I will be analysing data to give insight to stakeholders on investing in a new movie production studio based on the data collected from movie datasets.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

In the given findings we are going to use only the following data files:

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

### Method

This project uses descriptive analysis, including description of trends over time. This provides a useful overview of the trends in the movies produced over a period of time and the factors impacting their performance and ratings.

## Findings

Most popular genres: You can analyze this by grouping your data by genre and then calculating the average revenue, ratings, and count of movies for each genre. The genres with the highest average revenue, ratings, and count would be the most popular.

Most profitable years, months, and seasons: Group your data by release year, month, and season, then calculate the total revenue for each group. The years, months, and seasons with the highest total revenue would be the most profitable.

Characteristics of successful movies: You can identify these by looking at the movies with the highest revenue or ratings and analyzing their common characteristics, such as budget, runtime, cast, and director.

Ratings and reviews comparison: You can compare the ratings and reviews from different sources by calculating the correlation between them. A high correlation would indicate that the ratings and reviews from these sources tend to agree with each other.

## Recommendations for Microsoft's Movie Studio
Based on the results of this analysis, I make the following recommendations:

Focus on popular genres: If certain genres have significantly higher average revenue, it might be beneficial to focus on producing movies in those genres.

Release movies in profitable years: If certain years have significantly higher total revenue, it might be beneficial to release more movies in those years.

Emulate successful movies: If successful movies have certain common characteristics, it might be beneficial to try to emulate those characteristics in future movies.

Consider multiple ratings sources: If the ratings from different sources are highly correlated, it might be beneficial to consider all of them.

## Conclusion
In conclusion we can agree that:
1.The years, months, and seasons with the highest total revenue would be the most profitable.
2.The movie performance is highly affected by the characteristics , such as budget, runtime, cast, and director.
3.The data shows trends and gaps: which identified by analyzing the recent data and looking for patterns or changes over time.

## Next steps
Further analyses could yield additional insights to better understand the movie studio production industry such as:

1.Calculating the sales returns off the movie performance in the first week of release.
2.Seeing what to anticipate during a particular season off the rationale of customers preference based on the season.
3.Project for how long a movie will make sales returns and remain relevant based off the characteristic of the movie in hand.
